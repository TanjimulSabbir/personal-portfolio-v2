        Hi, Im <span className="title">Tanjimul Islam Sabbir</span>, a dedicated{" "}
        <span className="title">Front-End Developer</span> who thrives on
        building intuitive, scalable, and performance-optimized web experiences.
        <br />
        <br />I specialize in modern technologies like{" "}
        <span className="title">ReactJS</span>,{" "}
        <span className="title">TypeScript</span>,{" "}
        <span className="title">Redux Toolkit</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="title">Tailwind CSS</span>. My approach focuses on
        clean architecture, responsive design, and seamless user interaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        I‚Äôm currently working as a{" "}
        <span className="title">
          Junior Software Engineer at Utech Innovation
        </span>
        , where I help build real-time platforms with features like video/audio
        calls, multilingual support, and WebSocket-based chat. I‚Äôve contributed
        to products like a Brazilian e-commerce site, a travel booking platform,
        and an organic food delivery system.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my personal time, I explore technical depths that make frontend
        powerful. I enjoy solving{" "}
        <span className="title">complex logic problems</span>, diving into{" "}
        <span className="title">JavaScript execution contexts</span>, and
        understanding how browser engines handle rendering and re-rendering in
        React. Debugging <span className="title">performance issues</span> and
        finding bottlenecks in large React applications is something I genuinely
        enjoy.
        <br />
        <br />
        I‚Äôm also passionate about topics like{" "}
        <span className="title">caching</span>,{" "}
        <span className="title">memoization</span>, and data fetching
        strategies. Tools like <span className="title">RTK Query</span> and{" "}
        <span className="title">React Query</span> are a core part of my
        workflow. On the build side, I love exploring bundlers like{" "}
        <span className="title">Webpack</span>,{" "}
        <span className="title">Vite</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="title">Turbopack</span> to optimize performance and DX.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a background in <span className="title">Philosophy</span>, I bring
        analytical depth and creative thinking into development. Im currently
        sharpening my skills in{" "}
        <span className="title">Data Structures & Algorithms</span> to level up
        from junior to mid-level and beyond.
        <br />
        <br />
        I believe in writing maintainable code, designing with intent, and
        learning without limits. Let‚Äôs build something meaningful together.
